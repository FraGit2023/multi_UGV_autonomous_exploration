### **`ros_ws/src`** contains:

#### **`turtlebot3_gazebo`** 
- Forked and adapted from [ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations)
- Includes robot models and launch files to spawn TurtleBot3 in a Gazebo simulation and establish communication with ROS.

Modifications:
- in the `/launch` folder, a new file `spawn_turtlebot3_robot2.launch.py` has been created, based on the orginal file `spawn_turtlebot3.launch.py` included in the same folder. The new file allows to spawn the correct model of the robot and the correct bridge file;
- in the `/models/turtlebot3_burger` folder, a new file `model_robot2.sdf` has been created, based on the file `model.sdf`. Both files were generated starting from the original file `model.sdf` contained in the folder  `/models/turtlebot3_burger` in [ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations), modified for the correct management of the namespace in both gazebo and ROS2;
